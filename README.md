# Mail-Account-Migration
Simple program in Java I used for mail account migration from Merak to Zimbra **Contact

#Algorthm break down
The program was a simple text parser with regex. I exported a mail accounts text file from Merak then the use the file as input
in the program via command line.
The output would be in Zimbra's bulk account creation format, then pass the parsed output to the script provided by Zimbra
